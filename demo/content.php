$deployV1 = <<<'MD'
Every merge to `main` ships to production. There is no release train and no deploy freeze.

## Shipping a change

1. Branch from `main` and open a pull request.
2. Get one approving review. For anything touching payments, two.
3. Merge. The pipeline builds, runs the test suite and deploys.

```bash
git switch -c fix/invoice-rounding
git push -u origin fix/invoice-rounding
```

## If something breaks

Revert the merge commit and push. Then write it up, see [[Incident reviews]].
MD;

$deployV2 = <<<'MD'
Every merge to `main` ships to production, usually within four minutes. There is no release train and no deploy freeze.

3. Merge. The pipeline builds, runs the test suite and deploys.

```bash
git switch -c fix/invoice-rounding
git push -u origin fix/invoice-rounding
```

Risky changes go behind a flag first: see [[Feature flags]].

## Checking it worked

- Watch the deploy in `#ship-it`. The bot posts when the new build is live.
- Open the [[Service map]] dashboard and compare error rates for ten minutes.

- Watch the deploy in `#ship-it`. The bot posts when the new build is live.
- Open the [[Service map]] dashboard and compare error rates for ten minutes.
- Queue depth should stay under 500. If it climbs, page whoever is on the [[On-call rota]].

## Rolling back

Revert the merge commit and push; the revert deploys like any other change. If the pipeline itself is broken:

```bash
php artisan down --secret="halyard-ops"
./deploy/rollback.sh --to=previous
php artisan up
```

Then write it up within two working days, see [[Incident reviews]].

$incidentV1 = <<<'MD'
**Status:** resolved · **Severity:** 2 · **Lead:** Kenji Mori

Invoices generated between 09:12 and 09:51 rounded VAT down instead of to the nearest cent.

## Timeline

| Time  | What happened |
|-------|---------------|
| 09:12 | Deploy of the new tax engine |
| 09:40 | Support flags three tickets about totals off by one cent |
| 09:51 | Change reverted, see [[Deploy guide]] |
| 11:30 | Affected invoices reissued |
MD;

$incidentV2 = $incidentV1.<<<'MD'


## What we're changing

- [x] Property-based tests for every rounding mode
- [x] Tax engine changes ship behind [[Feature flags]]
- [ ] Alert when support tickets mention "invoice" more than five times an hour

> Nobody did anything wrong here. The test suite only checked whole-number amounts.

Welcome to the Halyard handbook: how we build, ship and support Halyard.

New here? Start with the [[Onboarding]] checklist.
MD, 'Created page'],

    ['31 days', 'Maya', 'Onboarding', <<<'MD'
Your first week, in order. Tick things off as you go.

- [ ] Get access to GitHub, the error tracker and `#ship-it`
- [ ] Read [[How we work]]
- [ ] Read the [[Deploy guide]], then ship a one-line change on day one
- [ ] Pair with whoever is on the [[On-call rota]] for an afternoon
- [ ] Skim the [[Glossary]]; nobody expects you to remember it

Questions go to your onboarding buddy, or straight into `#help`.

## Writing things down

If you explained something twice, it belongs in this wiki. Link generously: a link to a page that doesn't exist yet shows in red, and it's an invitation for whoever knows the answer.

## Meetings

- **Monday planning**, 30 minutes. We pick the week's goals, not tasks.
- **Thursday demo**, open to the whole company. Show something real, even if it's half done.

Everything else is async by default.

## Reviews

Review for correctness first, then clarity. Style is the linter's job. Approve with comments when the comments are small.

Halyard is a Laravel monolith with three supporting services.

Deploys go out the same way for all of them, see the [[Deploy guide]].
